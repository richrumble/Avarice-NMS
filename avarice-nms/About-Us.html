    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Avarice-NMS is insatiable and greedy on the back-end, smart, quick and intuitive on the front-end. Using the latest web
	standards (sorry IE) and techniques to make the best use of you and your companies time. Optimized to the fullest extent of
	our knowledge we offer the best, the most secure and the easiest to contribute to software suite on the internet today. 
	Avarice is patient and mindful of your order of operations, policies and procedures; Avarice scans and auto-discovery methods
	aim to be the least intrusive on the market, as well as the most thorough. Avarice can be configured to use an installed agent
	or in an "agent-less" (wmi|ssh|snmp) mode, again depending on your environments requirements.The security of the data that 
	flows in and out of Avarice was job #1, who and how that data is accessed was job #1a. This has led us to some design 
	decisions that probably are not popular, and these decisions have affected who will and won't be able to use Avarice as is. 
	Avarice is Open Source, and you are free to change or manipulate the Source Code (in accordance with GPLv2) as you see fit. 
    </p>
	<p>Avarice has been developed to our own likes and needs. From Work Flows, Helpdesk Ticketing, Asset and Inventory Tracking, 
	Network Graphing and Monitoring to Security Assessment and Reporting. We have packaged various pieces of knowledge like 
	sample company/security policies and procedures, added some Easter eggs as well adding in some proof of concept initiatives 
	others might draw inspiration from. We do not just add in components and modules, we make sure they can all tie in together 
	in a secure and equally important, useful manor. The Asset or Inventory System isn't just going to count and keep track of 
	the PC's and Servers on your network, it's going to make you notice when an asset becomes stagnate, orphaned or poorly 
	maintained. New assets, or when an asset changes (re-imaged, re-purposed etc..) will be brought to your attention. Users are 
	assets to your company so they are assets to Avarice. Accounts that are inactive or seemingly overactive will cause Avarice 
	to alert/report on those findings. Avarice will assist you in your security and compliance efforts, but it cannot... hmm 
	scratch that; will not do the fixing for you.
    </p>
	<p>Avarice is currently aimed at the problems we (RichRumble|ChrisBrodnik) face on a daily basis. While there is sure to be 
	a ton over overlap for many facing these same problems, we believe others will be able to take Avarice to a whole new echelon. 
	Using ACE (Acumen Correlation Engine), we offer the entire community anonymized, useful/current trends and updates for both 
	security and analytics.
